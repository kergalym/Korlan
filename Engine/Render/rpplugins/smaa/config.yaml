    - use_reprojection:
        type: bool
        default: true
        label: Use temporal antialiasing (SMAA T2)
        description: >
            This setting enables temporal antialiasing, which increases the
            antialiasing quality a lot. Basically the scene gets rendered a
            little different every frame, and the results of the current and
            the last frame get merged. This way, flickering is reduced by a lot,
            and the image becomes more smooth.

    - smaa_quality:
        type: enum
        default: ultra
        values: ["low", "medium", "high", "ultra"]
        label: SMAA Quality Preset
        shader_runtime: true
        description: >
            The quality of the smaa algorithm. Usually you should choose "ultra",
            since it does not have a significant higher cost, but provides way
            better quality. However, on low-end systems, it might be desireable
            to turn this value down.

    - jitter_pattern:
        type: enum
        default: halton8
        values: ["halton8", "skew_butterly", "uniform4", "halton256", "rotated4_helix2", "uniform2",
                 "halton16", "still", "rotated4", "rotated4_helix", "poisson10", "halton32",
                 "uniform4_helix", "uniform4_double_helix", "pentagram"]
        runtime: true
        label: Jitter sequence
        description: >
            Controls the jitter pattern to use

    - history_length:
        display_if: { use_reprojection: True }
        type: int
        range: [1, 16]
        default: 8
        shader_runtime: true
        label: History Length
        description: >
            History buffer size. This controls how long pixels will stay
            in the history buffer, greater values lead to smoother results
            but also might produce more artifacts.

    - jitter_amount:
        display_if: { use_reprojection: True }
        type: float
        range: [0.05, 2.0]
        default: 0.3
        runtime: true
        label: Jitter Amount
        description: >
            Controls how much each pixel is jittered, higher values might
            preserve better details but also introduce flickering.
